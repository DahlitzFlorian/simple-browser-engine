# Simple Browser Engine

## Description

In order to learn the Rust programming language, a simple browser engine was written.
It is mainly based on the articles series by [Matt Brubeck](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html).
His code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/mbrubeck/robinson).
